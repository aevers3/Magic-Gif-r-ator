# Magic Gif-r-ator

##The Challenge
Develop an application that can use buttons to call the Giphy API and display the returned gifs onscreen.

##The Solution
This app uses jQuery to make a front-end AJAX call to the Giphy API. It then displays the gifs onscreen in an organized fashion. Additionally, Gifs can be paused or started by clicking on them.

An added feature is the ability to add a button. The button label can be customized and will be used in the request sent to Giphy. Users can also choose to add a "random" button, which will randomly select an item from a local array and use that as the button label and search term.

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, Giphy API.
